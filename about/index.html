      <p>
        <strong>JAE SVN</strong> is an Argentine singer, rapper, songwriter, and
        music producer. He first started learning guitar and writing songs at
        the age of 8. He was always passionate about music, and he quickly
        developed his abilities for songwriting and guitar playing. In his
        teenage years, he took an interest in <strong>hip-hop</strong> and
        <strong>music production</strong>. He began to experiment with different
        styles of music, and he soon developed his own unique sound. As a result
        of his involvement with music, he created the
        <strong>HEPTAGON</strong> project in 2020. Two years later, Jae released
        his two first songs, <strong>"Discord"</strong> and
        <strong>"1000 Miles"</strong>. In 2023, he only released his third
        single called <strong>"Shine"</strong>, which could be considered the
        end of a trilogy following his last two songs. Starting 2024 he decided
        to end with the HEPTAGON project and take a different approach with his
        music, as a result, the name of the project was changed to
        <strong>KICK HAT SNARE</strong>.
